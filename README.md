# PharmaVision  

## Problem Statement  
To create a pharmacistâ€™s assistant, that automatically matches orders against handwritten prescriptions and creates orders for patients  
  
## Introduction  
A web application where users can upload an image of the prescription in JPG, JPEG and PNG formats, and get a clear overview of details like medicine name, dosage, frequency, duration, along with patient and doctor details. It additionally includes an AI powered medical assistant that enables users to ask questions about their medicine and get instant replies.  
  
## Key Features  
- A platform to upload an image of the prescription in JPG, JPEG and PNG formats.  
- Details extracted from the prescription will be clearly displayed in a structured manner.  
- An AI powered medical assistant that can instantly answer medication related queries.  
  
## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- OpenAI API Key  
- Necessary Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)  
  
##  Setup Instructions  
- Clone the repository.  
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set up environment variables: Add your OpenAI API key to keys.py

## Running the Application  
Use the following command to run the application:  `streamlit run Home.py`  
This will open the website in your browser, where you can access the application.  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- LangChain  
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- OpenAI
  
## Applications
